I have caught your interest somehow so I'll fill you in on what you may want to know. My name is Bodie. I am a biologist, a programmer, and I like to get as close to self-sufficiency as possible.

I recently began my graduate studies (Fall 2019) at the University of Georgia as a PhD student in their Integrated Life Science program.

This site serves as a dumping ground for my coursework, thoughts while reading, research progress, and personal activities. I will do my best to keep it organized.
