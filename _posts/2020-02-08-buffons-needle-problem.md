title: Buffon's Needle Problem

This second semester of graduate school is the first semester of classes that take some real thought. One of these classes has been particularly enjoyable and that is the class on probability and statistics. Prior to taking this course, I read [Probability And Statistics: The Science Of Uncertainty](https://www.amazon.com/Probability-Statistics-Science-Uncertainty-Mathematics/dp/0816062315) by Dr. John Tabak. This book was a comfortable walk through the history of these two fields and introduced the people who laid their foundations. 

One of the more fascinating (and easily interactive) ideas discussed in the book was [Buffon's needle problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffon%27s_needle_problem). While the original purpose of this experiment was not to approximate <sub>&pi;</sub>, it does a pretty good job of it via a Monte Carlo method. I thought that this would be a fit problem to simulate with [p5.js](https://www.p5js.org). Check it out [here](https://bweedop.github.io/buffons-needle).
