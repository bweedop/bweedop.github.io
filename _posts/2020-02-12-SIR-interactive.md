I recently joined Dr. Pej Rohani at the University of Georgia as a PhD student. A majority of the research done in our lab uses compartmental models to characterize disease transmission in a host population. One could design one of these models for just about any scenario you might see out in the wild. One of the simplest scenarios is characterized by the [SIR model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartmental_models_in_epidemiology#The_SIR_model_is_dynamic_in_three_senses) first introduced by Kermack and McKendrick in 1927.

I tinkered a lot when first learning about the behavior of the SIR model. I would change parameter values, use different initial conditions or try to use a range for both and then visualize the output. After spending a considerable amount of time plotting repititions of output, I thought that it might be better to develop [a simple web app](https://bweedop.github.io/sir-interactive/) that allows me to observe the model behavior smoothly and interactively.
