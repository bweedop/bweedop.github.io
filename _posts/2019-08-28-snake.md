If you are not having fun while programming, you are doing it wrong! Sometimes we have to reframe what our concept of fun during some projects but not this one. This was really my first attempt at building a game in the browser. It was an enjoyable project that tested my previous experience with HTML and CSS but also allowed me to play with the [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) Javascript package.

You can check out the code [here](https://github.com/bweedop/snake) or play the game [here](https://bweedop.github.io/snake)

p5.js is fun to play with and it makes creating visuals really easy! I want to play around with it some more in the future. The [particle system](https://p5js.org/examples/simulate-particle-system.html) and [flocking](https://p5js.org/examples/simulate-flocking.html) examples are captivating. I think a banner with a flocking graphic on my portfolio home page is going to be something I do in the future.
